# Edversity
Overview

Edversity is a learning application based on android platform. This application is meant for toddlers,
preschool and Kindergarten kids. Edversity features a series of fun loving activity for kids which help them
to learn various things about their surrounding in general.


Features

1) Learning and Alphabets and Numbers by tracing letters via vibrating feedback, it uses Deep Learning
neural network to recognize the letter and display the accuracy.
Model: Tensor flow and Keras, Dataset: MNIST by Kaggle.
2) Understanding Various Shapes by tracing them via vibrating feedback.
3) Learning about Colors and testing them via drag and drop interface.
4) Matching Like Objects (Shapes, Things, and Letters).
5) Recognizing live objects in surroundings, it works on a Convolutional Neural Network and labels every
trained object present in its surrounding in real time with 84% Accuracy.
6) Learning Pronunciation of Alphabets via Google’s speech to text API.
7) Understanding the sounds created by various animals.
8) Knowledge about Fruits and Vegetable and testing your skills.
9) Learning Rhymes via YouTube API.

Objective

The Current scenario of learning is with hard white pages with less visuals and practical knowledge. There
are only few successful applications which allow the kids to learn through mobile apps and can really be
productive. But, these application are hard coded and don’t use Artificial Intelligence into their system to
make it more Dynamic. The kids can’t get the knowledge about the things surrounding them. Edversity is
an interactive learning app built on android platform which uses Machine Learning to predict and teach
kids. Our System is the amalgamation of various features specified above. It also uses Neural Networks to
recognize the objects present in the environment and gives vibrating feedback.
